what is the purpose of RPC: To hide the complexity of http from the developers, call a function which under the hood is sending a http request ( openAPI spec file is similar)
what is the pupose of graphql : To let the developer specify on the frontend before sending the request this is what i need in the response. 

firebase function are good example of remote procedure calls: you call a function which under the hood is sending a http request 

Implementing a dumb RPC:
What if we could auto generate a client that a Node.js server can use and call a function on another service without worrying about the underlying axios / fetch call

difference b/w openAPI spec and RPC:
