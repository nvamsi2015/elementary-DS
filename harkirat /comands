npm init -y 
npx tsc --init ( npm install typescript )

change outdir, rootdir 
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist",

"module": "ESNext",                 #sometimes exporting functions gives swiggles then run this

npm install --save-dev ts-jest @jest/globals            

# --save-dev means it will save in devDependencies in package.json not dependencies. devDependencies are things that you only need in development not in production ec2 machine  

"devDependencies": {
    "@jest/globals": "^30.2.0",
    "ts-jest": "^29.4.5"
  }

npx ts-jest config:init         #creates jest.config.json keep the default as it is

# by default package.json will have this, when running npm run test it will normal throw error as no tests are there 

  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },

npm run test

> simple-app-1@1.0.0 test
> echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1

Error: no test specified

# now that we have added jest and ready to test 

#naieve way of adding test is 

  "scripts": {
    "test": "node /dist/index.test.js"
  },

#cleaner way

  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },


# jest will look for files ending with test.ts files in all the folders, so you can write by creating a test folder and in index.test.ts file or directly under src index.test.ts doesn't matter
