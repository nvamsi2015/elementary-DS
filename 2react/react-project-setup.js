// ------------ npx create-react-app is deprecated ------------

// As of February 2025,

// npx create-react-app is officially deprecated. It still works for existing legacy projects, and you can technically still use it to create a new app, but it is no longer recommended, actively maintained, or receiving updates. The React team officially announced its deprecation in February 2025. 
// For any new projects, you should use modern alternatives recommended by the official React documentation. 
// Why is it deprecated?
// No Active Maintenance: The project has no active maintainers, which means no new features, bug fixes, or security patches.
// Outdated Tooling: It relies on an older version of Webpack, which leads to slower build times and a poor developer experience compared to modern bundlers like Vite.
// Lack of Modern Features: CRA lacks built-in support for modern React features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which are essential for performance and SEO in production applications. 

// Recommended Alternatives
// The React team and the broader community recommend using production-grade frameworks or modern build tools for new projects.

// Next.js	            npx create-next-app@latest	Full-stack React applications, SSR, SSG, and SEO optimization.	
// Vite	                npm create vite@latest	    Simple, fast single-page applications (SPAs) with excellent developer experience (DX) and instant hot module replacement (HMR).
// Remix	            npx create-remix@latest	    Full-stack applications focusing on web fundamentals and nested routing.
// Expo	                npx create-expo-app@latest	Building universal React Native applications (iOS, Android, and Web).  
     
// For those following older tutorials that use npx create-react-app, the projects will still work for learning purposes, but it is strongly advised to transition to a modern tool for professional or long-term development.
