// Linking and Navigating
In Next.js, routes are rendered on the server by default. This often means the client has to wait for a server response before a new route can be shown. 
Next.js comes with built-in prefetching, streaming, and client-side transitions ensuring navigation stays fast and responsive.

This guide explains how navigation works in Next.js and how you can optimize it for dynamic routes and slow networks.
