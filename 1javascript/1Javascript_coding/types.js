// JavaScript has several data types, categorized into primitive types and object types.


// Data Type                                       Description                                                 Example

// Primitive Types

// Number                          Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.                         10, 3.14, -5
// String                              Represents a sequence of characters.                            "Hello World", 'JavaScript'
// Boolean                 Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.                  true, false
// Undefined               A variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.             let x; (x is undefined)
// Null                        Represents the intentional absence of any object value.                     let y = null;
// Symbol                  A unique and immutable data type, often used as object property keys.               Symbol('id')
// BigInt                          Represents whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1.                          9007199254740991n


// Object Type

// Object                  A collection of properties, where each property has a name (key) and a value.          let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
// Array                       A special type of object used to store ordered collections of data.                   let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
// Function                        A block of code designed to perform a particular task.                          function greet() { console.log("Hi"); }
// Date                                Represents dates and times.                                                     new Date();
// RegExp                          Represents regular expressions for pattern matching.                                /[a-z]+/
