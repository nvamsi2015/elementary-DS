---------Node-----------------
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts. 
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. 
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking 
and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, 
- like reading from the network, 
- accessing a database or the filesystem, 
instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.


This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.
Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.
In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.

Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.

Node.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking.
- The createServer() method of http creates a new HTTP server and returns it.

-------------- event loop ----------

The Node.js event loop is a crucial mechanism that enables Node.js to handle asynchronous operations efficiently, despite being single-threaded. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations and manage thousands of concurrent connections.
Here's how the Node.js event loop works:
Execution of Main Script (Synchronous Code): When a Node.js application starts, it first executes all the synchronous code in the main script.
Phases of the Event Loop: After the synchronous code finishes, the event loop enters a continuous cycle, processing different types of events in distinct phases:
Timers Phase: This phase handles setTimeout() and setInterval() callbacks.
Pending Callbacks Phase: This phase executes I/O callbacks that were deferred from the previous loop iteration.
Poll Phase: This is a crucial phase where Node.js retrieves new I/O events (like network requests, file system operations) and executes their corresponding callbacks. If there are no pending I/O events, it might wait for new events to arrive or proceed to the next phase if setImmediate() callbacks are scheduled.
Check Phase: This phase executes setImmediate() callbacks.
Close Callbacks Phase: This phase handles 'close' event callbacks, such as socket.on('close', ...).
Microtask Queue: In addition to the main event loop phases, Node.js also has a microtask queue that handles process.nextTick() callbacks and Promise callbacks. These microtasks are executed between each phase of the event loop and after the completion of the currently executing phase's callbacks.
Non-Blocking I/O: When an asynchronous operation (like a network request or file read) is initiated, Node.js delegates the task to the underlying libuv library, which handles the I/O operation using system resources (often in separate threads). Once the I/O operation completes, its associated callback is placed in the appropriate queue within the event loop to be processed in a subsequent cycle.
In essence, the event loop continuously checks for pending tasks in various queues and executes their associated callbacks in a specific order, ensuring that asynchronous operations are handled without blocking the main thread and allowing Node.js to maintain its non-blocking, efficient nature.



-------------- Expresss ----------------------  

Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Express is the most popular Node.js web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node.js frameworks
